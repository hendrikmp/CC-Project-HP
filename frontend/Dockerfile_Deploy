# --- STAGE 1: BUILDER ---
# Install dependencies and build the app
FROM node:24-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first (better caching)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the source code
COPY . .

# Build the Next.js app
# This creates the .next/standalone folder
RUN npm run build

# --- STAGE 2: RUNNER ---
# Create a small, clean image for production
FROM node:24-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV PORT=3000

# 1. Copy the "public" folder (images, favicon, etc.)
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

# 2. Copy the "standalone" folder (This is your actual server)
# It includes the minimal necessary node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./

# 3. Copy static assets (CSS, JS chunks)
# Standalone mode doesn't bundle these, so we copy them manually
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static

EXPOSE 3000

# Start the server directly (No "npm start" needed)
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
